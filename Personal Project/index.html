<h3>What my personal project was.</h3>
<p>For my personal project I decided to learn something completely new. I decided that I would learn how to code a website, and even with absolutely no knowledge of this before hand I was still able to accomplish my task. Choosing this topic taught me many things and made me realize how much time and effort really goes into the creation of any webpage or anything else that is coded.</p>
</hr>
<h3> Why I decided I would learn to code</h3>
<div class="indent"><p> A short summary of why I learned to code is:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>I thought it was interesting.</li>
<li>It was something that I knew nothing about.</li>
<li> I wanted to learn something new that I didn't know anything about. </li> 
</ol>
</hr>
<p> I mainly decided to code because, recently I have started to learn more about computers and how they work and how they are designed, and usually when I think about computers I think about coding and programming. While I was learning all this information a lot of sources mentioned coding. This caused me to start researching: what coding is, how it works and most importantly how to code. </p>
<P> I think coding is interesting because it is essentially another language that is used to make almost everything on the internet. To me it is just fascinating how just a few letters and numbers can make a website or even a video game.
